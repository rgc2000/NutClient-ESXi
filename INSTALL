HOW TO COMPILE
--------------

You will need a Linux environment to compile and create the VIB package
for ESXi

This module has been developped under a 32-bit CentOS 5 linux with the
following tools to compile the code (not exhaustive) :

  gcc
  gnu make
  tar
  ar
  sha256sul
  sha1sum
  gzip
  patch

The choice of CentOS 5 is to make the package compatible with ESXi 5 and
there is no need for generate 64 bit binaries for upsmon to work.

You will also need the original untouched source file archives for the
following packages :

  libressl-2.9.2.tar.gz
  nut-2.7.4.tar.gz
  smtptools-0.2.3

Check each package for their respective LICENSE.

The makefile will try to download using wget them if not already in the
base directory of this project. I can't guarantee that the urls for download
will remain valid through time, you should keep them archived somewhere.

To compile, login as root, go to base directory and type

  make

Everything should be automatically compiled and configured until the
end of the process

WHAT DO YOU GET
---------------

You will get a VIB file named upsmon-x.x.x-y.y.y.x86_64.vib depending on
the version of this package. x.x.x is the version of NUT, y.y.y is the 
version of this project.

And also and archive called NutClient-ESXi-y.y.y.tar.gz containing the VIB
file and variuos files to help for installation on ESXi host

COMPATIBILITY
-------------
This packages has been tested on ESXi from version 5.0 to version 6.7u2
